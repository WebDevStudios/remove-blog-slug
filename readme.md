# Remove /blog Slug


Removes the /blog slug from permalinks when you use multisite in subdirectory mode.


## How to use

Install and activate on site ID 1. After flushing permalinks, go to `Settings -> Remove /blog Slug` and the options will be updated so permalinks will function without that slug forcefully prepended.


## Warnings
You should only use this when you know there will be no manual url collisions. ie, network with domain mapping or if you're using a multi network plugin with no sites hanging off the main network/url.
